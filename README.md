## About the project.

The standard process of getting a mobile sim card in India is visiting a telecom operator store which will perform Aadhar e-KYC i.e. taking the customerâ€™s biometric data and sending it to the UIDAI to get the customer details. Once the customer is verified the sim card is issued. I am using SSI technology to reimagine the situation. The customer data will be verified without calling the Issuer i.e UIDAI.

## How to Run the Project

> NOTE: Use docker version V2. I am using  Docker Compose version v2.12.2. The network fails when run with docker-compose version 1.25.5
```
docker compose up -d --build 
```
It will create a network with three servers. You check the logs of each of the server by:
```
docker logs issuer -f
```
```
docker logs holder -f
```

```
docker logs issuer -f
```
