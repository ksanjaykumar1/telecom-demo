## About the project.

The standard process of getting a mobile sim card in India is visiting a telecom operator store which will perform Aadhar e-KYC i.e. taking the customerâ€™s biometric data and sending it to the UIDAI to get the customer details. Once the customer is verified the sim card is issued. I am using SSI technology to reimagine the situation. The customer data will be verified without calling the Issuer i.e UIDAI.

## Project FLow

## How to Run the Project

> NOTE: Use docker version V2. I am using Docker Compose version v2.12.2. The network fails when run with docker-compose version 1.25.5.

Create .env file from .env-sample in each of the issuer, holder and verifer folder. And run the following command from the root directory of this repo.

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

It will create a network with three servers. You check the logs of each of the server by:

```
docker logs issuer -f
```

```
docker logs holder -f
```

```
docker logs issuer -f
```

### Software Requirements

1. Docker
2. Docker Compose V2

> NOTE: Internet connection is a must because application interacts with online BCovrin Test Indy network and online mediator provided by Animo.

## Process Flow

There are two way to perfrom the operations.

1. Use the all three agents in the project.
2. **Use your mobile digital wallet as a holder (USE BC WALLET by British Columbia, the app is available in Play Store)** to perform the interaction. All three agents use online mediator which makes it possible to communicate outside the local system.

### Postman Collection

Postman collections are added in the docs folder. This need to be imported and used to communicate with the agents.
I have used the following global variable, please set these global variables for the project.

1. "issuerbase" and it's value is "localhost:3000"
2. "holderbase" and it's value is "localhost:5000"
3. "verifierbase" and it's value is "localhost:4000"
4. "version1" and its' value is "api/v1"
